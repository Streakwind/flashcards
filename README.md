simple little project because I am not paying for quizlet!

the latin words in this are from the AP Latin CED, appendix 2. I 
extracted the vocab tables using tabulas, and processed
the remaining csv with pandas (code in this repo)

tabulas did have errors due to the fact that the CED has vocab split between
lines sometimes. I used pandas to check the csv again and replace any new lines
with a space
